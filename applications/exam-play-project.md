### Please describe the game's core loop? (minimalistic)

MINT -> FORGE -> TRADE -> COMPETE

### Are there any existing games that you would consider similar to your project?
*If so, please list them and describe how your game compares or differs.*

When considering games similar to "The Big Ballz of Bajun," we can look at various titles that blend elements of art creation, NFTs, and competitive gameplay. However, "The Big Ballz of Bajun" stands out due to its unique integration of these elements. Here are a few games that share some similarities and how "The Big Ballz of Bajun" compares and differs:

CryptoKitties:
Similarity: CryptoKitties allows players to collect and breed digital cats, where each cat is a unique NFT. It involves trading and breeding to create rare attributes.
Difference: "The Big Ballz of Bajun" extends beyond collection and breeding by incorporating a deep artistic creation process, competitive tournaments, and a comprehensive affiliate system. The artistic component is more pronounced and integral to the gameplay, offering a layered artistic development of each collectible.

Art Blocks:
Similarity: Art Blocks focuses on the creation and trading of generative art as NFTs. Each piece of art is algorithmically produced, ensuring uniqueness.
Difference: While Art Blocks is primarily about collecting generative art, "The Big Ballz of Bajun" combines art creation with an active gameplay loop and community-driven competitions. It also offers a more interactive experience with the forging of artworks and the ability to influence their evolution through gameplay decisions.

Axie Infinity:
Similarity: Axie Infinity involves collecting, raising, and battling fantasy creatures called Axies, with a strong emphasis on competitive play and trading.
Difference: "The Big Ballz of Bajun" differentiates itself by focusing on the creation and transformation of art rather than just battling. The game incorporates a detailed affiliate program and seasonal tournaments that are tied to the artistic progression of the collectibles, making the art itself a key element of strategy and competition.

Decentraland:
Similarity: Decentraland is a virtual world where players can buy, sell, and build on virtual land, creating experiences and artworks in a blockchain-based economy.
Difference: "The Big Ballz of Bajun" is more focused on individual art creation and competitive gameplay within a structured environment of minting, forging, and trading. Unlike Decentraland's open-world format, it offers a more directed and curated artistic journey tied to specific gameplay objectives and rewards.

Unique Selling Points of 'The Big Ballz of Bajun':
Artistic Creation & Transformation: Offers players a hands-on approach to creating and evolving digital art, going beyond simple collection and trading.
Integrated Competitive Elements: Features structured tournaments where art and strategy merge, enhancing both the value and utility of each creation.
Community and Collaboration: Bolstered by an affiliate system that encourages community growth and collaboration, enhancing player engagement and retention.
